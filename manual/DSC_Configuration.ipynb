We endeavor to maintain a simple syntax to configure a DSC. This documentation covers the basic DSC syntax for users to get started quickly.

    "## Improving DSC script readability\n",
    "### Use comments\n",
    "As with many scripting languages (R, Python, shell), `#` can be used to make human-readable explanation to the contents of DSC script. We suggest using single `#` to distinguish between various types of syntax groups introduced in this document, and double `##` to annotate parameters. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Various modules to estimate location parameter\n",
    "mean, median: mean.R, median.R\n",
    "    # parameters\n",
    "    ## set to 0 for no winsorization\n",
    "    winsorize: 0, 0.02\n",
    "    # input\n",
    "    x: $x\n",
    "    # output\n",
    "    $mean: mean\n",

    "### Turn on YAML syntax highlighter\n",
    "Although DSC script is not compatible with YAML, the syntax highlighter for YAML is good enough to enhance readability of DSC scripts. You may turn on the YAML syntax highlighter in your text editor when composing DSC scripts."
