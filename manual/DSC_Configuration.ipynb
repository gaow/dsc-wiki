Before indulging, please refer to [Design and Features](Design_and_Features.html) and [Terminology](Terminology.html) for high-level discussions that will help better understanding DSC syntax. \n",

(**FIXME: create these tutorials and add links to them**)\n",

    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A module block is conceptually consisted of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `property`\n",
    "* `input`\n",
    "* `parameters`\n",
    "* `output`\n",
    "\n",
    "and, optionally, `decorators` that provide customization to flavors of modules. Note that we do not use these exact terms as keywords in module syntax, yet as will be illustrated soon, these components distinguish from each other syntactically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module property\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules, the building blocks of DSC, can be minimally specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on the first line (aka the \"module property\" line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two elements separated by `:` are module names and executables. The module named `normal` corresponds to `rnorm.R`, `t` corresponds to `rt.R`. For cases when there are multiple module names on the left of `:` yet only one executable on the right, eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: simulate.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then the two modules will share the same executable (yet, to be discussed later, possibly different module parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compound module executables\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple scripts can be connected with `+` for one module to allow them be loaded sequentially as if they are concatenated to one script. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "method: utils.R + main.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will load `utils.R` followed by `main.R`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "method1, method2: (utils1.R, utils2.R) + main.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will load `utils1.R` followed by `main.R` for module `method1`, `utils2.R` followed by `main.R` for module `method2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inline executables\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to use scripts to specify module executables, [language interpreter](#Language-interpreters-133) operators can be used to define codes for modules inline. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal: R(x = rnorm(n))\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be combined with scripts as a concatenation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "method: utils.R + R(res = main(...))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[Variable wild-card](#Variable-wildcard-131) `$()` can be used inside language operators to specify module inputs so that they do not have to be defined separately. Please read [this tutorial](../tutorials/Inline_Executable.html) for a concrete example.\n",

Here `n` is set to `1000`. When set to an array-like value, eg `n: 100, 500, 1000` then effectively 3 modules are defined for `normal` and `t` each. Take `normal` for example:\n",

    "When a parameter specifies a filename yet to be created by a module instance, `file()` can be used to ensure a file is properly generated without racing with other module instances. This is achieved by properly name the file for each module instance. `file()` takes a *file extension* string, and DSC will automatically give it a unique and informative basename. The file can either be a module output that DSC will keep track of as pipeline variable, or an intermediate file that will not be used in other modules. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Parameter `plink_bed` is also a file, but it is not a module output. This will create a situation where a properly named file `*.bed` is generated to the output directory yet we do not keep track of it: this means deleting this file manually afterwards will not trigger rerun of the pipelines involved. We keep these files just in case we may want to examine them to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also use the `.` notation for file extensions to enhance readability, for example `file(.bed)` is equivalent to `file(bed)`.\n",

    "#### Extension not specified\n",

    "When using `file()` without specifing the extension, it generates a file path in the system [temporary folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder) and can be used as a \"temp file\". It will not appear in users' work directory, and as with other system temp files there is generally no need to worry about their management / maintenance. In the example above the parameter `plink_bed` can well be made a temporary file if users deem that there is no need to keep it for trouble-shooting:\n",
