    "## Module headline\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules, the building blocks of DSC, can be specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on the first line (aka the headline):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two elements separated by `:` are module names and executables. The module named `normal` corresponds to `rnorm.R`, `t` corresponds to `rt.R`. When there are multiple module names on the left of `:` yet only one executable on the right, eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: simulate.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then the two modules will share the same executable (but different module parameters to be discussed later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module Inheritance\n",
    "Modules can be inherited on the headline as a shorthand to define new modules based on existing ones. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",

    "shifted_normal(normal): \n",
    "    mu: 1\n",
    "```\n",

    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    mu: 1\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation syntax makes module definitions not only more succint but also conceptually more clear -- in this example we can tell that `shifted_normal` is basically `normal` with additional parameters."

    "## Block properties: optional\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional block properties fine-tunes how the main properties are combined, renamed or defines the particular environment running a DSC block. Available optional properties are `.logic`, `.alias` and `.options`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### .logic\n",
    "`.logic` defines how parameter values are combined. It can be used outside or inside `params`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For executables\n",
    "When `.logic` appears outside `params` (typically unter `exec` ), it annotates the logic beind `exec` useing the `+` operator to specify how the computational routines should be combined. By default, routines under `exec` are independent from each other; yet this can be changed via `.logic`, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    method:\n",
    "        exec: test1.R, test2.R\n",
    "        .logic: exec[2], exec[1] + exec[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC will then run two procedures: one only involving `test2.R`, the other runs `test1.R` followed by `test2.R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy user case for `.logic` under `exec` is pre/post processing of data in between plugin and non-plugin, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  admixture:\n",
    "      exec: make_ped.py $data $ped,\n",
    "            admixture $ped $K > $output,\n",
    "            new_admixture_method.R $data $output\n",
    "      .logic: exec[1] + exec[2], exec[3]\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "        K: 3, 6, 9, 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here two different admixture analysis methods are compared: the `admixture` program and a new method under development, coded in `new_admixture_method.R`. The `admixture` program requires input data in PED format, and a `make_ped.py` script is used to convert data to PED. `.logic` here indicates that `exec[1]` is a pre-processor for `exec[2]` and they should always be executed as one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When `.logic` appears inside `params`, it overrides the default logic (that all parameters are combined the Cartesian product style). These operators can be written in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* simple logic statement with `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "* Pythonic syntax: with Python keywords and lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    n: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500\n",
    "    mu: 0, 1\n",
    "    exec[1]:\n",
    "      sigma: 1, 2\n",
    "      .logic: (.n <= 300 and .mu == 0) or (.n > 300 and .mu == 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `.logic`, DSC will exhaust all combinations of 5 values of `n`, 2 of `mu` and 2 of `sigma`, a total of 20 parallel jobs. The `.logic` here states that instead of 20 jobs, DSC will first run 3 values of `n` with `mu = 0` and 2 values of `sigma`, then run another 2 values of `n` with `mu = 1` and `sigma = 1`, which is a total of 8 jobs. Notice that parameter index slicing makes it possible to run a subset of parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can use pythonic syntax, for example with `in`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      .logic: (.n in [100,200,300] and .mu == 0) or (.n in [400, 500] and .mu == 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to refer to variables in `.logic` the dot `.` prefix has to be added to variables. Failure to obey this rule will result in error complaining of invalid logic statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### .alias\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "`.alias` is often used to adjust parameter names for input to different executables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    mu: 1, 2, 3\n",
    "    exec[2]:\n",
    "      .alias: theta = mu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in this example, all `exec` takes a parameter named `mu`, except for `exec[2]` which requires parameter with name `theta`, but `theta` in `exec[2]` is equivalent to `mu` in other `exec`. To deal with this situation the `.alias` option can be used to rename `mu` to `theta` for `exec[2]` while keeping it as is for other executables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plugins, `.alias` is often used with [`List()` (or `Dict()`)](#List()-or-Dict()-137) operator to consolidate parameters to a single data object (`list` for R, `dictionary` for Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For executables\n",
    "`.alias` outside `params` should have a one-to-one correspondence with `exec` entry. The goal of `alias` here is to rename executables for output to DSC database that will be [annotated and queried from](DSC_Annotation.html) after executing the DSC. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  pi0_score:\n",
    "      exec: score.R\n",
    "      .alias: score_pi0\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "      return: result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `.alias`, the output step name in DSC database for this DSC block will be `score.R`. With `.alias` however, the output step name will be changed to `score_pi0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than enhancing readiability, `.alias` is particularly useful when the same `exec` is used as different steps for different purposes. For example as demonstrated in [the complete version of the example above](../tutorials/Intermediate_R_1.html) the `score.R` routine is used to evaluate both $\\pi_0$ and $\\beta$ estimates. It is necessary to distinguish between these two contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.alias` can also be used along with `.logic` for `exec` to rename composite steps. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "simulate:\n",
    "  exec: BM.R, MultiBM.R, PostProcBM.py, PostProcMultiBM.py\n",
    "  .logic: exec[1] + exec[3], exec[2] + exec[4]\n",
    "  .alias: BM, MultiBM\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope of optional properties inside `params`\n",
    "\n",
    "When these parameters appear in `params` but outside any `exec[i]`, then they will also effect all parameters under `exec[i]` when applicable. However this behavior can be overloaded inside `exec[i]` if the same parameter is re-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take `.alias` for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    mu: $mu\n",
    "    beta: $beta\n",
    "    .alias: theta = beta\n",
    "    exec[2]:\n",
    "      .alias: theta = mu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for all `exec` except for `exec[2]`, the `theta` parameter will take the value of `beta`, whereas for `exec[2]` the `theta` parameter takes value of `mu`."

    "### File()\n",
    "\n",
    "*FIXME: multiple return files are not yet implemented as of Jan 16, 2017.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two user cases with `File()` operator: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Without an extension\n",
    "2. With an extension specified, eg. `File(txt)` or equivalently `File(.txt)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension not specified\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `File()` without specifing the extension, it generates a file path in the system [temporary folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder) and can be used as a \"temp file\". It will not appear in users' work directory, and as with other system temp files there is no need to worry about their management / maintenance (in the example below the variable `ped` may well be set a temporary file if users deem that there is no need to keep it for trouble-shooting).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension specified\n",
    "\n",
    "When a parameter is a file name but the file is yet to be created by a module instance, a `File()` operator can be used to ensure a file is properly generated without racing with other module instances. `File()` operator takes a **file extensions**, and DSC will automatically give it a unique basename. The file can either be a pipeline variable `output` that DSC will keep track of, or an intermediate file that will not be used in other modules. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "      input:\n",
    "          data: $sim\n",
    "          K: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "          ped: File(ped)\n",
    "          score: File(score)\n",
    "      output: \n",
    "          $score: score\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the output `score` is a file, generated by the module taking parameter `data` and parameter `K`. This will result in multiple `score` output files. Names of these `score` files will be automatically assigned so that users do not have to worry about naming them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter `ped` is also a file, but it is not referred to in `output`. This will create a situation where a properly named file `*.ped` is generated to the output directory yet we do not keep track of it: this means deleting this file manually afterwards will not trigger rerun of the pipelines involved. The reason we do not make it a temp file via `File()` (no extension) is because we may want to look into it for debugging. DSC also offers [command options --clean / purge](./) [FIXME: only `purge` is now implemented] to systematically remove these intermediate files later to free up disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also use the `dot` convention for file extensions to enhance readability, for example `File(.ped)` is equivalent to `File(ped)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List() or Dict()\n",
    "\n",
    "*FIXME: partial conversion is not yet implemented as of Jan 16, 2016.*.\n",

    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  .alias: args = List()\n",
    "```\n",
    " will convert all variables in corresponding parameter space, say `x,y,z` to `args = list(x = ..., y = ..., z = ...)`. Likewise, `List()` will convert parameters to `dictionary` in Python. Partial conversion is also supported, for example `args = List(x, y)` will only convert selected variables to R list which will be translated to R code `args <- list(x = x, y = y)`. \n",
    " \n",
    "The operator has two names in order to indicate that in R it binds variables to `list` and in Python `dict`. However these two operators can be used interchangably. Using the one or another matching the executable type only helps with readability of the DSC configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index and slicing\n",

    "*  Index for `exec`. Each element corresponds to a computational routine in `exec`.\n",
    "*  Index for `params` values when appeared in `.logic` inside `params`; each element corresponds to a subset of the `params` value involved.\n",
    "*  Index for block names in `DSC::run` sequence; each element corresponds to a computational routine in `exec` for the block involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing syntax is allowed. For example, `n[1,2,4]` extracts the first, second and forth elements of `n`. `n[1:4]` extracts elements 1 though 4, and `n[1:9:2]` extracts elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n",
