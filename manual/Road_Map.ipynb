This feature is useful when the cost of computation for a procedure is trivial compared to the cost of storing its output. For example if a simulation procedure is simply `runif(500000)` it makes more sense to save this line of code and execute it inline with the next step, rather than to save a vector of 500,000 random numbers to disk.\n",
