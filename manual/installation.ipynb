    "## Requirement\n",
    "DSC2 requires Python 3.6+. If you do not have this version of Python 3 on your system it is strongly recommended that you install it from [`conda`](https://conda.io/docs/), a package manager for `Python`. This is the \"cleanest\" way to install, especially when there are multiple versions of Python in your system paths that you are worried about breaking or removing -- `conda` installer will also guide you to make it your default Python 3 so you do not have to remove your old installation.\n",
