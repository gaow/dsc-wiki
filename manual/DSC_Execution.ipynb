We will use toy DSC examples (including breaking down [this toy](https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/blob/master/vignettes/one_sample_location/settings.dsc)) to introduce a special syntax block called `DSC` that defines benchmark pipelines and execution. This block has a reserved headline `DSC` and is required for all DSC scripts. In this document we refer to its contents by `DSC::<key>` where `<key>` is the identifier on the left side of `:` in each line of the `DSC` block."

These logic are implemented via `*`, `,` and `()` operators:\n",
