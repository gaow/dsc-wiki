    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC uses one additional configuration file and two command options (`--host` and `--to-host`) to run on a remote computer (or \"host\", hereafter). Here a remote computer can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A standalone desktop workstation without a job queue system\n",
    "2. A system with a job queue manager, such as PBS-based cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC facilicate two approaches to run remote tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"On-Host\", the conventional way: log in to the host and run remote jobs. For a standalone system, this is no difference from logging in to the system and run DSC benchmark directly. For a cluster system this will automatically submit jobs to compute nodes based on provided template.\n",
    "2. \"Local-Host\", a host friendly way: do not log in to the host to run jobs. Rather, have a copy of DSC software installed to your local computer (Mac or Linux), and configure the host to have DSC and all required tools for benchmarking installed. Then run DSC from local computer with additional folders to be synced to the host specified by `--to-host` option. The local computer will serve as the job dispatcher and job monitor. This provides a way to run on hosts that has some policy constraints on long running jobs from the headnode, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, DSC configures all modules and converts them to [`SoS`](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs) tasks. Enthusiastic readers shall refer to [this page](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/doc/documentation/Remote_Execution.html) for details under the hood. Configuration here in DSC is further automated for benchmarking and thus simpler interface-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll focus on discussing running jobs on a cluster with queue manager."

    "1. Configure job submission on host.\n",
    "2. Configure resource requirement per module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using command options, users can\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit the entire benchmark with controlled maximum job limits (command option `-c`).\n",
    "2. When submitting from local to host computer, automatically send required files to the host for benchmarking (command option `--to-host`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can also use SoS utility tools to manage jobs. The end of documentation will briefly discuss a few SoS utility commands with examples."

For example, [here is a template](https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc-reg/blob/master/midway.yml) for a system running PBS type of queue via Slurm Workload Manage:"

    "The section `DSC` is required to provide various templates for a number of systems. Here `midway2` is a host provided by [The University of Chicago RCC group](https://rcc.uchicago.edu). Jobs are submitted to `partition=broadwl`. Typically it has 40 cores per node, allows for maximum of 40 concurrent jobs per user, and a maximum running time of 36hrs per job. These limitations have been reflected by the `max_*` values in the configuration. \n",

Also relevant is the `faraway2`, also `based_on: midway2`, but specifies the address of how to connect to `midway2`.

    "- `time_per_instance`: maximum computation time for each module instance.\n",
    "- `instance_per_job`: how many module instances to submit as one remote job. This is useful consolidating numerous light-weight module instances into one jobs submission. \n",
    "- `n_cpu` and `mem_per_cpu` specify the CPU and memory requirement of a module instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for 100 module instances of `simulate` that each generates some data in under a minute, one can specify `time_per_instance: 1m` and `instance_per_job: 200`. Then a single job containing 200 simulations will be submitted to the host with a total of 200 minutes computation time reserved.\n",

    "Typically, `DSC` and `default` section for host configuration do not have to be changed for different projects. Users can carefully configure them once, and reuse for various projects.

    "In the configuration file, `max_running_jobs` confines the maximum number of jobs to run on the host. This is set to have a safe limit that prevents from harming the host sytem (and getting angry system emails). For each benchmark submitted, the command option `-c` should be used to customize the maximum number of jobs to have in the queue. Command `dsc -h` will show you the default value of this number. Since it is a shared command option with running jobs locally, the default is set to ~1/2 of the total available CPU threads on the computer that executes `dsc`. That is, for the \"On-Host\" submission the default number of jobs will be half of threads on the head node; for the \"Local-Host\" submission the default will be half of threads on a local computer, which can be quite small when running from, say, a regular laptop. It is thus advised to always specify `-c` option."
