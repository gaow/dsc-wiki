    "If you are reading this page and are in need of R & Python communications, I suppose you might have experience interacting between R and Python, and appreciate the challenges. Data transfer between R and Python currently depends on `rpy2`. This has 2 implications: 1) information flow is no longer lossless because it is impossible to support the Python counter part for any arbitary R object (and vise versa) and 2) installation of `rpy2` and get it to work can be challenging. While I cannot provide support for `rpy2` installation, here is a [personal note](https://gist.github.com/gaow/39902e16603ffbe185ae38ff062fa266) on how I got it work on my system, possibly the hard way, but might be of interest to those who are in the same situation as I did. Additionally, 3) there is noticible performance overhead at the data transfer interface.\n",
