    "\n",
    "In DSC, all information is passed from one module to another through *pipeline variables*. All pipeline variables are indicated with a `$` as the first character, as in `$data` or `$mean_test_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, when a module outputs a pipeline variable, the value of this variable is saved to a file; and when a pipeline variable is provided as input to a module, the value of this variable is read from a file. You will never need to access these files directly; DSC provides a user interface that allows you to access (*i.e.*, query) the pipeline variables without having to know where or how they are stored. In the previous tutorial we illustrated how the pipeline variables can be queried in R."

    "## Planning a DSC file\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of DSC is to make your benchmark, or computational experiment, easier to read, easier to maintain, and easier to extend. To achieve these aims, we recommend that you to start by planning out your DSC project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest starting the planning by identifying the *module types* (the key computational steps in your benchmark) and the *pipeline variables* (the quantities being fed from one step to another). All pipeline variables should be given informative names (which must begin with a `$`). It is also helpful to give the modules informative names. (*Note:* unlike other programming languages such as R, names in DSC cannot have a period.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, in our working example, that we compared methods for estimating a population mean from a simulated data sample. Although this example was very simple—DSC can handle much more complex settings than this—this example is useful for explaining the basic ideas behind DSC.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example followed the **simulate-analyze-score** design pattern, meaning that the benchmark could be naturally decomposed into three module types:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A `simulate` module that generates a vector of simulated data (`$data`), and the population mean setting used to simulate these data (`$true_mean`).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An `analyze` module that accepts `$data` as input, and outputs an estimate of the population mean (`$est_mean`).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A `score` module that accepts inputs `$est_mean` and `$true_mean`, and outputs an error measure (`$error`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our DSC has four pipeline variables: `$data`, `$true_mean`, `$est_mean` and `$error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, we have summarized this information in the comments at the top of the DSC file (the `#` character indicates a comment in a DSC file—anything after a `#` is ignored by DSC):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# PIPELINE VARIABLES\n",

    "## Two important notes about pipeline variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The variables outputted by modules should also include the parts of your benchmark that you want stored for future use. For example, `$error` is here considered a module output since we would like to use this quantity to study the results of the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *The pipeline variables are the only way that modules can communicate with one another.* So if a module requires access to a piece of information generated by a previous module, then this must be a pipeline variable. For example, a `score` module requires access to the true mean used to generate the data, so here this quantity is assigned to a pipeline variable `$true_mean` from a `simulate` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, *all information in a DSC program is local to each module unless it is defined as a module output and assigned to a pipeline variable using the `$` character.*"

    "2. The R script implementing the module is a single line of code: `x <- rnorm(n,mean = 100,sd = 1)`. Here, `R()` tells DSC that this code should be parsed and evaluated as an R script. For longer code, this should be replaced with the name of a file containing the R code. Any global variables (that is, variables that are not local to a function) defined inside a script are called \"script variables\"; in this module, one script variable is defined, `x`.\n",

So, in this example, `simulate * analyze * score` generates all pipelines that consist of a module from the `simulate` group (`normal` or `t`), followed by a module from the `analyze` group (`mean` or `median`), and then a module from the `score` group (`sq_err` or `abs_err`). **In this example, there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$ different pipelines defined by this `run` statement.**"

    "\n",
    "+ **In DSC, each module input and output is assigned a different value within each pipeline.** This is very different from most programs where each variable is assigned a single value. For example, `score.error` has 8 different values for each of the 8 different pipelines. (We did not include the `simulate.data` module output in this table because it is too large to show here, but its value can be extracted like the other outputs.)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Information flows between modules within the same pipeline.** In the first pipeline (the first row of the table), for example, the error in the `abs_err` module (0.05858) is calculated from (1) the value of the true mean, which was set to 0 in the `normal` module, and (2) from the estimated mean, which was set to 0.05858 in the `mean` module."

    "## Pipeline evaluation, and *alternatives*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we observed that DSC generated 8 pipelines, in which each 8 pipeline is different combination of modules, and contains a different set of results. Now we explain at a high level how DSC produced these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DSC runs the two `simulate` modules, `normal` and `t`, then stores the values assigned to `$true_mean` and `$data`. Therefore, the module outputs `$true_mean` and `$data` have two **alternative values**: the value assigned by running the `normal` module, and the value assigned by running the `t` module. (For example, the alternative values of `$true_mean` are 0 and 3.) `normal` and `t` are **alternative modules** in the `simulate` group. Therefore, although the `normal` module appears in 4 pipelines, and the `t` module also appears in 4 pipelines, each `simulate` module only needs to be run once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DSC runs the two `analyze` modules, `mean` and `median`, then stores the values assigned to the  module output, `$est_mean`. The `mean` module is run twice, once for each alternative value of `$data` (the value of `$data` is assigned to module input `x` in the `mean` and `median` modules). Likewise, the `median` module is run twice, once for each alternative value of `$data$`. Therefore, the `analyze` step is evaluated 4 times in total, and the module output `$est_mean` has 4 alternative values. If you look closely at the `dscout` data frame above, you will see that the `analyze.est_mean` contains 4 unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DSC runs the two `score` modules, `sq_err` and `abs_err`. These modules both accept two pipeline variables as input, `$est_mean` and `$true_mean`. Since there are 4 alternative assignments to both `$est_mean` and `$true_mean`, each `score` module is evaluated 4 times, so in the end DSC stores 8 different values for the final module output, `$error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach would have been to run the `simulate` step 8 times, the `analyze` step 8 times, and the `score` step 8 times, but that would have been a waste of time, since many of the computations would be redundant. DSC performs the minimum amount of computation needed to generate the results for all the pipelines by generalizing the steps described here. Although wasted computation will have little noticeable effect on a small experiment such as this, this could be very important when large data sets are being simulated and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, under the hood, the order of evaluation may not be exactly as we described it here—for example, the `mean` and `median` modules might be evaluated with the output from `mean` before the `t` module is availabled—but the exact order of evaluation is unimportant for understanding how the DSC results are generated."
