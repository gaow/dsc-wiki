    "The [Quick Start](quick_start.html) example contains 3 DSC blocks, `simulate`, `estimate` and `mse`. Suppose we now have a new computational routine for location estimate via the *Winsorized* mean. The routine is implemented as `winsor.R`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "  mean = psych::winsor.mean(x, trim = trim, na.rm = TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to incorporate this new computational routine into DSC: either by adding it to the existing `estimate` block, or by adding a new block. For `winsor.R` there is an additional parameter `trim` which does not exist in `estimate`. We will show here two flavors to update, both involving minimal changes to the DSC file and result in the same outcome. In practice one should always try to adopt a flavor that is most logically clear and succinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add Steps to Existing Block\n",
    "We change the `estimate` block to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  estimate:\n",
    "      exec: mean.R, median.R, winsor.R\n",

    "      return: mean\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where we appended the new executable `winsor.R` to the `exec` entry, along with an executable specific parameter specification in the `params` section to assign two possible values to `trim` which essentially provides two versions of Winsorization for comparison.\n",
