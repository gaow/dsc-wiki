    "The [Quick Start](quick_start.html) example contains 3 DSC blocks, `simulate`, `estimate` and `mse`. Suppose we now have a new computational routine for location estimate via the *Winsorized* mean. The routine is implemented as `winsor.R`:\n",

    "There are two ways to incorporate this new computational routine into DSC: either by adding it to the existing `estimate` block, or by adding a new block. For `winsor.R` there is an additional parameter `trim` which does not exist in `estimate`. We will show here two flavors to update, both involving minimal changes to the DSC file and result in the same outcome. In practice one should always try to adopt a flavor that is most logically clear and succinct.\n",
