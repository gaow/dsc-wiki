    "## DSC Specification\n",
    "The DSC problem is to assess location parameter estimation methods via simulation studies. We will simulate data under normal distribution and *t* distribution with 2 degrees of freedom; then estimate the location parameter using mean and median, and finally compare the performance of estimators by computing the difference between the estimate and the underlying parameter. The problem is fully specified in DSC2 language below:\n",

    "All computational routines in this DSC are R scripts (each with one line of code!), located in directories as specified in the `DSC::exec_path` entry of the configuration file. Contents of these R scripts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",

    "  x=rnorm(n,mean=true_mean)\n",
    "  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to ensure the parameter names and return variable names match between R script and DSC files. For example the `simulate` block involves computational routines `rnorm.R` and `rt.R`, both take parameters `n` and `true_mean` and generate a new variable `x` as return value (the other return variable `true_mean` already exists as an input parameter). The R script, `rnorm.R`, is ` x = rnorm(n, mean = true_mean)`, which uses the input parameters `n` and `true_mean` on the right hand side to produce `x` on the left hand side, as the return value of the `simulate` block. The same holds for `rt.R` which is `x = true_mean + rt(n, df = 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DSC::run` entry reflects a typical DSC setup where `simulate` creates *scenarios* under various settings, `estimate` applies various *methods* to analyze data and `mse` is a *score* that measures the performance of different methods. They are connected by `*` to allow for all possible combinations of computational steps from these 3 blocks."
