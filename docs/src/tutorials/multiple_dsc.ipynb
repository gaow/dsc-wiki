    "## DSC Specification and Execution\n",
    "The DSC problem is similar to what we have previously worked on, i.e. comparison of location parameter estimation methods. This time we simulate data under *t* distribution (df = 2) and Cauchy distribution. Then before estimating location parameter using mean or median method, there is an **optional** `transform` step where we provide two methods for *Winsorization*. This results in two possible DSC sequences:\n",
