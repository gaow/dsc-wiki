    "*  `-j` specifies number of CPU threads to use. You may run DSC in parallel on a single desktop, or on distributed computer system that runs `Redis` server / worker (FIXME: link to tutorial), in which case `--host` will have to be specified.\n",
    "*  `-v` controls verbosity level. Default level is 2. If you encounter error messages you can increase the verbosity level to output more information to diagnose the cause.\n",
    "*  `-o` changes the default output filename / directory specified in the DSC script.\n",
    "*  `-f` forces executing DSC or extracting DSC results without using existing cache. During a DSC execution, cache files of intermediate output and parameters are saved so that future re-runs of the same computation will be skipped. The `-f` option forces DSC to ignore existing cache and run the entire procedure from scratch.\n",
    "* `--target` by default, is the name of the last DSC block if the DSC procedure only runs one sequence. Otherwise the name of the last DSC block has to be provided when `-a` or `-e` switches are turned on.\n",

    "## DSC Execution options\n",
    "* `-x` specifies the DSC configuration script.\n",
    "* `--sequence` specifies which particular DSC sequence to run. See this [section](https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc2/wiki/04-Multiple-DSC-Sequences#execute-sequences-from-command-line) for an example.\n",
    "*  `--recover` executes DSC using existing output files without checking for their properties. This is useful when files are migrated from one computational system to another: `--recover` prevents DSC from re-running due to change of file properties (mostly absoluate path to file) in this case.\n",
    "*  `--clean` will remove specified DSC steps, instead of executing them. In order to remove data properly, the dsc result meta data (and RDS file defined in `DSC::output`) must be accessible.\n",

    "These options will annotate DSC by applying \"tags\" to DSC results. This is a pre-processing step to DSC results extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-a` specifies the annotation file. See this [section](DSC_Annotation.html) for an example annotation file. The annotation file must have the same prefix as the corresponding DSC configuration file. Otherwise one needs to use `-a annotation.ann dsc_script.dsc` to specify both of them.\n",
