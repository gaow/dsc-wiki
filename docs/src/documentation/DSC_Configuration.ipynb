    "## Block Properties: main\n",
    "Main properties of a DSC block are `exec`, `seed`, `params` and `return`, of which `exec` and `return` are required and `seed` and `params` optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### exec\n",
    "`exec` specifies the names of executable computational routines as well as their command line arguments if applicable. For example an `exec` entry reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  exec: datamaker.R, ms $nsam $nreps -t $theta -seed $seed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where data is generated by two programs, `datamaker.R` and `ms`, with command line arguments `nsam`, `nreps` and `theta` & `seed` for `ms`. Although `exec` takes arbitrary command line programs, if the computational routine is [a plugin](Design_and_Features.html#Executable-modes), for example `datamaker.R`, then there is no need to explicitly specify input parameters such as `nsam` and `nreps` for non-plugin routine `ms`. Caution that for plugin the parameter names must match the variable names coded in the plugin script and for non-plugin the input parameters should start with `$` followed by parameter names which should be found under the [`params`](#params) entry of **the same block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`exec` is a required parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### params\n",
    "`params` defines parameters to be used by computational routines in `exec`. It is a indented list with labels (parameter names) corresponding to command arguments (for non-plugin mode) or variable names (for plugin mode) of `exec`. A typical `params` reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    n: 1000, 2000\n",
    "    mean: 0, 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which indicates that there are 2 input parameters, namely `n` and `mean`, for computational routines in `exec`. Combinations of parameter values (Cartesian product style by default) will be assigned to all `exec` unless [otherwise instructed](#.logic). For example, each executable under `exec` will take 4 sets of parameter from the example above: `(n = 1000, mean = 0), (n = 1000, mean = 1), (n = 2000, mean = 0), (n = 2000, mean = 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`params` is optional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `exec` specific parameters\n",
    "Often we need to sepcify parameters unique to one `exec` but not applicable to others. Executable specific parameter assignment is needed in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    n: 1000, 2000\n",
    "    mean: 0, 1\n",
    "    exec[1]:\n",
    "      t: 5, 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `n` and `mean` are shared by all `exec` but parameter `t` is only used by the first executable (indexed by `[1]`) in `exec`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grouped parameters\n",
    "This is a \"house-keeping\" feature that organizes parameters in groups to enhance readability. These group names will be ignored by DSC2 interpreter in action. For example the following two blocks are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    sample_params:\n",
    "      n_samples: 1000, 2000\n",
    "      p_cases: 0.5\n",
    "    genotype_params:\n",
    "      n_snps: 500, 800\n",
    "      n_genes: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    n_samples: 1000, 2000\n",
    "    p_cases: 0.5\n",
    "    n_snps: 500, 800\n",
    "    n_genes: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### seed\n",
    "`seed` sets random seeds for programs that use random number generators. This is a frequently used feature in simulation studies where multiple replicates for the same analytical routine are required. Setting a range of seeds naturally creates *replicates* of the same scenario or same methods. If there are plugins in `exec`, DSC will call language specific functions (`set.seed()` in R and `numpy.random.seed()` in Python) to set seeds; otherwise the seed values will be treated same as a parameter in `param` and be passed to `exec` the same fashion as other parameters, for example `ms ... -seed $seed` as demonstrated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "`seed` is optional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### return\n",
    "`return` parameter are values to be saved to disk at the end of computation for each block. Only `return` values of a block can be referred to by other blocks (via the `$` symbol). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  simulate:\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "      return: x, y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then `return` values `x` and `y` can be used in other blocks, for example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  test:\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "        z: $x\n",
    "        y: $y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where input parameters `z` and `y` for \"test\" consists of values from `return` of the `simiulate` step `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to apply *alias* to return. There are two types of alias supported: extract and re-name. For example to extract a specific attribute from an R list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  return: data, beta = R(data$meta$beta)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then in addition to returning `data` which is an R list, it also returns value `beta` which is part of the `data` list, i.e., `data$meta$beta`. For another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  return: x, y = x_new\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `x` and `x_new` exist in data but `x_new` is returned as another variable named `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to specify return alias specific to executables, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  return:\n",
    "    exec[1]: score = lkhd\n",
    "    exec[2]: score = mse\n",
    "    exec[3]: score = fisher\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For plugin executables, return value should match a variable name in the corresponding script and thus may or may not be in `params`. For non-plugin executables, return value hae to be one of the `params` values as it is impossible to set other values to a non-plugin executable other than the `params` specification. If return value is a file name (via [File()](#File()) syntax), the corresponding file will be registered to DSC2 to track for possible changes further down the pipelines.\n",

    "## Block properties: optional\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional block properties fine-tunes how the main properties are combined, renamed or defines the particular environment running a DSC block. Available optional properties are `.logic`, `.alias` and `.options`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### .logic\n",
    "`.logic` defines how parameter values are combined. It can be used outside or inside `params`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For executables\n",
    "When `.logic` appears outside `params` (typically unter `exec` ), it annotates the logic beind `exec` useing the `+` operator to specify how the computational routines should be combined. By default, routines under `exec` are independent from each other; yet this can be changed via `.logic`, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    method:\n",
    "        exec: test1.R, test2.R\n",
    "        .logic: exec[2], exec[1] + exec[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC will then run two procedures: one only involving `test2.R`, the other runs `test1.R` followed by `test2.R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handy user case for `.logic` under `exec` is pre/post processing of data in between plugin and non-plugin, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  admixture:\n",
    "      exec: make_ped.py $data $ped,\n",
    "            admixture $ped $K > $output,\n",
    "            new_admixture_method.R $data $output\n",
    "      .logic: exec[1] + exec[2], exec[3]\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "        K: 3, 6, 9, 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here two different admixture analysis methods are compared: the `admixture` program and a new method under development, coded in `new_admixture_method.R`. The `admixture` program requires input data in PED format, and a `make_ped.py` script is used to convert data to PED. `.logic` here indicates that `exec[1]` is a pre-processor for `exec[2]` and they should always be executed as one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When `.logic` appears inside `params`, it overrides the default logic (that all parameters are combined the Cartesian product style). These operators can be written in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* simple logic statement with `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "* Pythonic syntax: with Python keywords and lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    n: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500\n",
    "    mu: 0, 1\n",
    "    exec[1]:\n",
    "      sigma: 1, 2\n",
    "      .logic: (.n <= 300 and .mu == 0) or (.n > 300 and .mu == 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `.logic`, DSC will exhaust all combinations of 5 values of `n`, 2 of `mu` and 2 of `sigma`, a total of 20 parallel jobs. The `.logic` here states that instead of 20 jobs, DSC will first run 3 values of `n` with `mu = 0` and 2 values of `sigma`, then run another 2 values of `n` with `mu = 1` and `sigma = 1`, which is a total of 8 jobs. Notice that parameter index slicing makes it possible to run a subset of parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can use pythonic syntax, for example with `in`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      .logic: (.n in [100,200,300] and .mu == 0) or (.n in [400, 500] and .mu == 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that to refer to variables in `.logic` the dot `.` prefix has to be added to variables. Failure to obey this rule will result in error complaining of invalid logic statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### .alias\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "`.alias` is often used to adjust parameter names for input to different executables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    mu: 1, 2, 3\n",
    "    exec[2]:\n",
    "      .alias: theta = mu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "in this example, all `exec` takes a parameter named `mu`, except for `exec[2]` which requires parameter with name `theta`, but `theta` in `exec[2]` is equivalent to `mu` in other `exec`. To deal with this situation the `.alias` option can be used to rename `mu` to `theta` for `exec[2]` while keeping it as is for other executables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For plugins, `.alias` is often used with [`List()` (or `Dict()`)](#List()-or-Dict()-137) operator to consolidate parameters to a single data object (`list` for R, `dictionary` for Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For executables\n",
    "`.alias` outside `params` should have a one-to-one correspondence with `exec` entry. The goal of `alias` here is to rename executables for output to DSC database that will be [annotated and queried from](DSC_Annotation.html) after executing the DSC. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  pi0_score:\n",
    "      exec: score.R\n",
    "      .alias: score_pi0\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "      return: result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `.alias`, the output step name in DSC database for this DSC block will be `score.R`. With `.alias` however, the output step name will be changed to `score_pi0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other than enhancing readiability, `.alias` is particularly useful when the same `exec` is used as different steps for different purposes. For example as demonstrated in [the complete version of the example above](../tutorials/Intermediate_R_1.html) the `score.R` routine is used to evaluate both $\\pi_0$ and $\\beta$ estimates. It is necessary to distinguish between these two contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "`.alias` can also be used along with `.logic` for `exec` to rename composite steps. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "simulate:\n",
    "  exec: BM.R, MultiBM.R, PostProcBM.py, PostProcMultiBM.py\n",
    "  .logic: exec[1] + exec[3], exec[2] + exec[4]\n",
    "  .alias: BM, MultiBM\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### .options\n",
    "\n",
    "*FIXME: this feature is not yet implemented as of Jan 16, 2017. With the cluster support we may end up using a separate cluster job configuration file for it to keep DSC configuration file concise.*\n",
    "\n",
    "`.options` include parameters that controls behavior of the corresponding `exec` as it executes, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  .options: ncpu = 2, mem = 4G\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  `ncpu`: Number of required CPUs.\n",
    "*  `mem`: Required memory.\n",
    "*  `inline`: True or False, of whether or not an R script is executed inline with the next procedure instead of producing return files. This feature is useful when the cost of computation for a procedure is trivial compared to the cost of storing its output. For example if a simulation procedure is simply `runif(500000)` it makes more sense to save this line of code and execute it inline with the next step, rather than to save a vector of 500,000 random numbers to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope of optional properties inside `params`\n",
    "\n",
    "When these parameters appear in `params` but outside any `exec[i]`, then they will also effect all parameters under `exec[i]` when applicable. However this behavior can be overloaded inside `exec[i]` if the same parameter is re-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take `.alias` for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  params:\n",
    "    mu: $mu\n",
    "    beta: $beta\n",
    "    .alias: theta = beta\n",
    "    exec[2]:\n",
    "      .alias: theta = mu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for all `exec` except for `exec[2]`, the `theta` parameter will take the value of `beta`, whereas for `exec[2]` the `theta` parameter takes value of `mu`."

    "When using `File()` without specifing the extension, it generates a unique string that you can potentially use as file prefix, step identifier, etc. Different from `File(ext)` the string `File()` generates does not have a path to the temporary folder. It is a temporary variable rather than a temporary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List() or Dict()\n",
    "\n",
    "*FIXME: partial conversion is not yet implemented as of Jan 16, 2016.*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used in `.alias` entries to help construct variables for plugin executables. For example for an R plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  .alias: args = List()\n",
    "```\n",
    " will convert all variables in corresponding parameter space, say `x,y,z` to `args = list(x = ..., y = ..., z = ...)`. Likewise, `List()` will convert parameters to `dictionary` in Python. Partial conversion is also supported, for example `args = List(x, y)` will only convert selected variables to R list which will be translated to R code `args <- list(x = x, y = y)`. \n",
    " \n",
    "The operator has two names in order to indicate that in R it binds variables to `list` and in Python `dict`. However these two operators can be used interchangably. Using the one or another matching the executable type only helps with readability of the DSC configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index and slicing\n",
    "Index can be used in the following context:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Index for parameters in `exec` entry, for example `exec: makeped.py $data $output[1]` where `output` parameter takes the form of `output: (1.ped, 1.map), (2.ped, 2.map)`. In this case `output[1]` will only use the first value of each parameter group.\n",
    "*  Index for `exec`. Each element corresponds to a computational routine in `exec`.\n",
    "*  Index for `params` values when appeared in `.logic` inside `params`; each element corresponds to a subset of the `params` value involved.\n",
    "*  Index for block names in `DSC::run` sequence; each element corresponds to a computational routine in `exec` for the block involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing syntax is allowed. For example, `n[1,2,4]` extracts the first, second and forth elements of `n`. `n[1:4]` extracts elements 1 though 4, and `n[1:9:2]` extracts elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Inheritance\n",
    "When one want to write a new block similar in configuration to an existing block, block inheritance can be used to help new block definition become succinct. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "  SVA:\n",
    "      exec: SVA.R\n",
    "      params:\n",
    "          data: $data\n",
    "          .alias: List(args)\n",
    "      return: data\n",
    "\n",
    "  RUV(SVA):\n",
    "      exec: RUV.R\n",
    "\n",
    "  voom(SVA):\n",
    "      exec: voom.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the 3 blocks differ only in the executable name. With block inheritance, we can completely configure `SVA`, then inherit it to configure \"RUV\" and \"voom\" where only `exec` have to be re-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comment string\n",
    "As with many scripting languages (R, Python, shell), `#` can be used to make human-readable explanation to the contents of DSC script."
