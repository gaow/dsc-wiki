    "DSC2 is designed to execute a sequence of computational steps that generate (or gather) data, perform statistical analyses and evaluate the performance of statistical procedures involved. Each step will take some input and create some output. A DSC2 user thus has two jobs: define the steps, and define the sequence of steps.\n",

In the domain of methods comparisons any DSC sequence should follow along the line of these 3 broad types of steps_\n"

These routines generate `n` random samples under Cauchy distribution with location parameter `true_loc`, and *t* distribution with non-centrality parameter `true_loc`, respectively. There are 2 choices of computational routines, each routine has one choice of `n` (1000) and two choices of `true_loc` (0 and 1). 5 replicates are evaluated as defined by `seed`. As a result, the \"simulate\" block has 20 parallel computational steps.\n",

In this part, there are two types of procedures: the first is `transform + estimate` which runs the \"transform\" family of steps first, then run the \"estimate\" family after data has been transformed; the second is `estimate` which directly performs parameter estimation with the original data produced by its upstream computational steps.\n",

It does not have to be this way, though: one can even make separated blocks for each computational routine (in this case for every R script) and combine them in the *run* sequence in *DSC* section. The style adopted in this example appears to be the most reasonable choice because computational routines sharing input and output are consolidated into single blocks, and logic between blocks reflecting the DSC design are clearly presented.\n",

Within a DSC block, all parameter variables should be considered *local* to the block, not accessible from outside the block; all returned values should be considered *global* variable accessible from other DSC blocks via `$` sigil. It is legitimate and sometimes necessary that multiple blocks have the same variable name in their return entry, for example here both \"simulate\" and \"transform\" blocks return `x`. In such case, which block provides value `$x` depends on the context of the DSC sequence. The implicit rule here is that DSC2 will always search for the nearest upstream block that yields the variable it looks for. For example, the DSC sequence `simulate * (transform * estimate, estimate) * mse` can be expanded to `simulate * transform * estimate * mse` and `simulate * estimate * mse`. In the first sequence, `$x` in \"estimate\" comes from its direct upstream neighbor \"transform\", not \"simulate\", while in the second sequence `$x` comes from \"simulate\".\n",

    "DSC2 will consider a computational routine a *plugin* when the `exec` is R or Python script, and the return value is not [`File()`](DSC_Configuration.html#File()). Computational results and communications between blocks will be handled implicitly (via RDS files). In plugin mode, users only have to make sure the variables used in plugin scripts are defined in the DSC script not the plugin scripts, and the return value for the DSC block should be one or multiple variables in the plugin script. All the computational routines in the example above are plugins written in R.\n"
