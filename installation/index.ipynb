    "## Overview of DSC components\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC consists of several components that interact with each other. Before beginning the installation, it is helpful to know: (1) what is being installed, (2) where DSC is installed, and (3) what software is needed to run DSC successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install DSC, you will need to have the following software on your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Python](http://python.org) (version 3.6 or greater).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Several Python modules, including NumPy and Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optionally, [R](https://www.r-project.org). Although not required, to get the full benefit of DSC we recommend installing R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DSC software consists of the following three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A [Python module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) called `dsc`. It is installed in the same location as other Python modules (unless you choose to override the standard choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two Python executables, `dsc` and `dsc-query`, that can be run from the command-line shell. These executables are also installed and managed by the `pip` program. It is installed in the same location as other Python executables (unless you choose to override the standard choice).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An R package called `dscrutils` that provides an interface for querying DSC results in R, as well as tools to run R code inside a DSC program. It is installed in the same location as other R packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete installation of DSC not only involves installing these components, but also setting up your computing environment to ensure that these components can communicate with each other. We will explain how to do this in the steps below."

    "## 1. Install python >= 3.6\n",
    "\n",
    "To use DSC, you must have Python version 3.6 or greater. There are several ways you can install Python >= 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our recommendation:** Install Python via a [conda](https://conda.io/docs)-based package manager such as [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). If you are starting from scratch, we recommend [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). See [here](#Troubleshooting) (*TO DO: fix this link*) for additional advice on installing and configuring Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Other options:** DSC will also work with standalone distributions of Python (e.g., downloaded from [Python.org](https://www.python.org)), and the instructions below should work regardless of how Python is installed on your computer. However, we recommend `conda` because it will provide easy access to various Python packages DSC depends on, thus making it a lot easier to install DSC."

    "## 2. Check your Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "DSC is distributed via [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dsc). The simplest way to install a Python module from pypi is with `pip`. [All recent Python versions are by default bundled with pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing). Before running `pip`, check that you are running the version bundled with Python >= 3.6:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "python3 --version\n",
    "pip3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reported Python version is or greater than 3.6.0 and `pip` is reported to come from that version (eg. `pip 9.0.1 from /path/to/python (python 3.6)`), then you are ready for the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** *In the instructions below, we assume your Python 3.6+ executable is `python`, and your pip (python 3.6+) executable is `pip`. However, you might need to replace `python` with `python3` and `pip` with `pip3`.* \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have an old version of Miniconda or Anaconda installed, but you do not have Python >= 3.6, see [here](#Troubleshooting) (*TO DO: fix this link*) for advice on how to proceed."
