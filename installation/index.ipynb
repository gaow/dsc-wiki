    "To use DSC2, you must have Python version 3.6 or greater. There are several accepted ways to install Python >= 3.6 for DSC2. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our recommendation:** install Python via a [conda](https://conda.io/docs)-based package manager such as [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). If you would like to start from scratch we recommand using [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) due to its light-weight and consquently less complications. [Here](#Troubleshooting) are some novice advice on installation and configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Other options:** DSC2 will also work with standalone distributions of Python (e.g., downloaded from [Python.org](https://www.python.org), and the instructions below should work regardless of how Python is installed on your computer. However, we recommend `conda` because it will provide easy access to various Python packages DSC2 depends on, thus making it a lot easier to install DSC2."

[All recent Python versions are automatically bundled with pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing). Before running `pip`, check that you are running the version bundled with Python >= 3.6.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** *In the instructions below, we assume your Python 3.6+ executable is `python`, your pip (python 3.6+) executable is `pip`. However, you might need to replace `python` with `python3` and `pip` with `pip3` if they otherwise point to other versions* \n",
