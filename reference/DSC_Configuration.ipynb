(**FIXME: create these tutorials and add links to them**)\n",

    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A module block is conceptually consisted of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `property`\n",
    "* `input`\n",
    "* `parameters`\n",
    "* `output`\n",
    "\n",
    "and, optionally, `decorators` that provide customization to flavors of modules. Note that we do not use these exact terms as keywords in module syntax, yet as will be illustrated soon, these components distinguish from each other syntactically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module property\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules, the building blocks of DSC, can be minimally specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on the first line (aka the \"module property\" line):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: rnorm.R, rt.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The two elements separated by `:` are module names and executables. The module named `normal` corresponds to `rnorm.R`, `t` corresponds to `rt.R`. For cases when there are multiple module names on the left of `:` yet only one executable on the right, eg:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal, t: simulate.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then the two modules will share the same executable (yet, to be discussed later, possibly different module parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compound module executables\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple scripts can be connected with `+` for one module to allow them be loaded sequentially as if they are concatenated to one script. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "method: utils.R + main.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will load `utils.R` followed by `main.R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tuple operator](#Tuple-operator-132) `()` can be used in conjuction with `+` to expand the logic of concatenation, as a shorthand to define multiple compound executables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "method1, method2: (utils1.R, utils2.R) + main.R\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will load `utils1.R` followed by `main.R` for module `method1`, `utils2.R` followed by `main.R` for module `method2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inline executables\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to use scripts to specify module executables, [language interpreter](#Language-interpreters-133) operators can be used to define codes for modules inline. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "normal: R(x = rnorm(n))\n",
    "    n: 1000\n",
    "    $x: x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "method: utils.R + R(res = main(...))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, \n",

Here `n` is set to `1000`. When set to an array-like value, eg `n: 100, 500, 1000` then effectively 3 modules are defined for `normal` and `t` each. Take `normal` for example:\n",

    "It is also possible to specify a parameter with groups of values, for example, `p: (0.1, 0.9), (0.2, 0.8)` will initialize 2 modules each with parameter `p` of length 2.\n",

    "When multiple parameters are specified, eg:\n",

    "#### Extension not specified\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `file()` without specifing the extension, it generates a file path in the system [temporary folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder) and can be used as a \"temp file\". It will not appear in users' work directory, and as with other system temp files there is generally no need to worry about their management / maintenance. Itis useful when there is a need to create some intermediate file for a module to run, yet there is no need to keep it for trouble-shooting. In the example above, parameter `file1` is a temporary file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extension specified\n",
    "\n",
    "`file()` with extension will result in a unique and informative basename for use in a module instance, and will result in files under the DSC output directory. When used as a module parameter, intermediate file cache are generated and saved, but will not be tracked by DSC or used in other modules. This means deleting this file manually afterwards will not trigger rerun of the pipelines involved. When used as a module output, DSC will keep track of it as pipeline variable that other modules can use. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "t1: R(print(cache); write(out, 0))\n",
    "  n: 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "  cache: file(cache)\n",
    "  $out: file(txt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the output `out` is a file name string, generated by the module taking parameter `n` in 4 different values. This will result in 4 module instance each with an output. Names of these `out` files will be automatically assigned for use with the downstream pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter `cache` is also a file name string, but it is not a module output. This will create a situation where a properly named file `*.cache` is generated to the output directory yet we do not keep track of it: We keep these files just in case we may want to examine them to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also use the `.` notation for file extensions to enhance readability, for example `file(.txt)` is equivalent to `file(txt)`."
